It focused on exploring the social aspect of cyber security awareness and resilience. Specifically, in that, we tried to develop a solution targeting young (12-18 years old) and elderly individuals. This involved creating a campaign and game prototype to increase security awareness. The topics covered include general and cyber security introductions, psychology and social engineering, research perspectives, controls (human, technical, and organizational), privacy and law, cybercrime, cybersecurity awareness in schools, and European initiatives/projects.
